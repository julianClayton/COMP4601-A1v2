# A distributed search engine
The search engine uses a crawler to ‘crawl’ the internet and create a graph-representation of the pages crawled. It then proceeds to index the pages. The search engine then performs Page-Rank on the graph and allows a user to query the pages crawled locally and by all other users who are currently running the search-engine.
